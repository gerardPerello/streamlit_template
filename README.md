# streamlit_template
This is a template for creating a Streamlit app.

## How to Setup?

Follow these steps to set up the Streamlit app:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:** Start by creating a virtual environment for your project. This ensures that your project dependencies are managed effectively. You can find a guide on how to create a virtual environment [here](https://nimbusintelligence.com/2023/12/virtual-environments-python/).

2. **Install Required Libraries:** Run the installation of libraries using the `requirements.txt` file. This file contains all the necessary Python libraries that your Streamlit app will need.

3. **Create Credentials File:** You need to create a `Credentials.py` file using the `Credentials_Template.py` as a guide. This file will be used for the Snowflake connection.

4. **Run the Streamlit App:** Finally, to run the Streamlit app, use the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    streamlit run your_app.py
    ```

    Replace `your_app.py` with the name of your main Python file.

Follow these steps to ensure a smooth setup of your Streamlit app.
